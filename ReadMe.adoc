# Arcade Booth System

This repository contains the schematics, part list, and code to reproduce a classic arcade booth. Currently only the game Tic Tac Toe exists in the booth, but an additional menu could be programmed in to add additional games. Pictures and schematics are available in the folder "pdfs".

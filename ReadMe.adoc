# How this application works:
 
This application is a tic tac toe arcade style video game booth. Its arcade booth casing is made out of Lego. It supports single player vs. the computer or multiplayer vs. a friend. Upon plugging it in, it displays a welcome message. After that, it asks to select a game mode (single or multiplayer). If multiplayer is selected, it will begin to commence gameplay. If single game mode is selected, it will commence gameplay. The computer will choose the option left over. Upon winning the game, the player who won will be outputted to the screen. If there is a tie, it will output that there is a tie. After a game finished, the first menu (select a game mode) is outputted to the user again. The system repeats from there.

Note: the wire diagram, photos of the application, and the entire parts list is in the `specs.pdf` file.


To control menus and select pieces, a joystick (10k analog potentiometer) is used. To click options, an LED button is used. An LED matrix displays the output that the user sees.


The program is implemented in the C++ programming language using the Arduino IDE.


The programs ‘main’ function is in the file Arcade_Booth.ino. It is where all the modules are connected and the gameplay loop is. The files draw_board.cpp and draw_board.h are where the gameplay is physically drawn to the matrix. The module menu.cpp/ menu.h is where some of the games menus and pop up messages are displayed (others are embedded in the main function, because sometimes it made more sense when the joystick was involved) . The module game_logic.h/.cpp is where the game data and all game functionality is stored. Joystick.cpp / .h is where the joystick driver program is written. It allows the main function to interact with the joystick. The button is implemented in the main file with a few lines of code. Because it was so simple to implement, it was the only hardware input that didn’t require a module. The only external libraries used was the driver program for the matrix. It is listed in the ‘hardware components used’ under the hardware component in which used it. 


Hardware Components Used:

-	Two 16 by 24 LED chainable matrices produced by Adafruit. They were used as a screen to display the tic tac toe game. 
o	Note that this required an external library. It was a driver to interface between the programmer and the hardware. This library was downloaded from https://github.com/adafruit/HT1632 .

-	Elegoo Uno R3 produced by Elegoo via their super starter kit.

-	Arduino Uno R3 shield produced by Elegoo via their super starter kit.

-	14 short male to male wires from Elegoo via their super starter kit.

-	Loose Lego bricks purchased at the Lego store. Used as a shell for the arcade booth. The bricks came in three types:

o	Blue 4 by 2 studs (the amount was two small containers from the Lego store). There containers are standardized and can easily be repurchased, however no link exists for them from an online outlet. Must be purchased at a Lego store location that sells loose bricks. 

o	Black 6 by 2 studs (the amount was two large containers from the Lego store. There containers are standardized and can easily be repurchased, however no link exists for them from an online outlet. Must be purchased at a Lego store location that sells loose bricks

o	One blue Lego baseplate 32 by 32 studs
